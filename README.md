## Objective

- The objective of this project is to illsutrate a simple, real life simulation of interactions between two messengers (Alice and Bob)
and an adversary (Chuck) attempting to infiltrate their conversations. The catch is that the conversations are encrypted with various (3)
encryptions in which the adversary will have to decrypt.

## Main Features
- Server
  - When creating the server, simply type in a numerical input of any size (4 digits is recommended) and click connect.
  - The server must be created before anything else and the numerical input will be shared with ALL parties.
- Messenger
  - If you are a messenger, you will need to input the designated numerical input in which was created by instantiating the server.
  - Once connected, you will be given a list of users who are within the same server.
  - Click your desired partner and you will be able to chat with them through the messaging input. 
- Attacker
  - Similar to the messengers, you too will require the input the numerical server input to connect to your desired server.
  - The main difference is you will also be required to input a certain setting indicating what kind of challenge you would undergo
  before your connection. 
  - The challenges are derived based upon what kind of information you want to be given as the adversary.
